1. Write a C / C++ program to accept a C program and do error detection & correction for the following. (CO1) 
Check for un-terminated string constant in the input C program. i.e A string constant begins with double quotes and extends for more than one line. Intimate the error line numbers and the corrective actions to user. 

2. Write a C / C++ program to accept a C program and do error detection & correction for the following. (CO1) 
Check for un- terminated multi line comment statement in your C program. 

3. Write a Lex program to accept a C program and do error detection & correction for the following. (CO1) 
 Check for un-terminated string constant in the input C program. i.e A string constant begins with double quotes and extends for more than one line. Intimate the error line numbers and the corrective actions to user. 
4. Write a Lex program to accept a C program and do error detection & correction for the following.(CO1)
 Check for valid arithmetic expressions in the input C program. Report the errors in the statements to user. 

5. Write a Lex program to accept a C program and do the following error detection & correction.(CO1) 
Check for the valid usages of numerical constants in the input C program. Intimate the invalid usages to user. 
6. Check for valid declarative statements in your program. (CO1) eg: int a,b;

7. Write a Lex program to accept a C program and do the following error detection & correction.(CO1) 
Check for the valid if statement in the input C program. Report the errors to users. 

8. Check for un- terminated multi line comment statement in your C program.(CO1)

9. Write Yacc program to accept a statement and do the following error detection.(CO2)
